This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to type juggling. The `calculateSum` function calculates the sum of numbers in an array.  However, if the array contains a string that can be implicitly type-casted to a number (like '4'), the summation behaves unexpectedly. This unexpected behavior is because PHP's loose typing can lead to silent type coercion, causing bugs that are difficult to debug.
